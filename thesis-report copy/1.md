## **Abstract**

The digital transformation of education has accelerated the demand for engaging, interactive, and scalable e-learning platforms. Traditional online learning systems often suffer from low student engagement, a lack of dynamic content, and challenges in maintaining academic integrity. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of TEKUTOKO, a novel web-based educational platform that addresses these challenges by integrating gamification, artificial intelligence, and a microservice-based architecture.

The TEKUTOKO system provides a feature-rich environment where educators can create and host interactive "game rooms" with mission-based learning activities, including photo scavenger hunts, riddle challenges, and workflow submissions. A key innovation is the AI Question Generator, a Node.js-based module that leverages Google's Gemini Pro API to automatically create diverse and contextually relevant quiz questions, significantly reducing the content creation burden for educators. The platform's architecture is built on a robust stack featuring a React.js frontend with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern user interface, and a Node.js/Express backend managing core business logic and API services. System scalability and modularity are enhanced through the use of a Python-based microservice for DOCX file processing, MySQL for persistent data storage, and Firebase Storage for handling file uploads.

To enhance user motivation, TEKUTOKO incorporates a comprehensive reward mechanism, allowing hosts to issue digital vouchers and prizes. Furthermore, a location-based discovery feature utilizes GPS to help users find nearby educational events, fostering a sense of community. To ensure academic integrity, an anti-cheating system is implemented to monitor user behavior, such as tab switching and inactivity. The platform is fully internationalized, supporting English, Vietnamese, and Japanese to cater to a global user base.

This research evaluates the effectiveness of the TEKUTOKO platform through a series of experiments measuring system performance, user engagement, and the quality of AI-generated content. The findings demonstrate that the integration of gamification and AI-driven tools leads to a significant improvement in user satisfaction and learning outcomes. The microservice architecture proves to be a scalable and maintainable solution for modern EdTech applications. This thesis contributes a comprehensive framework for developing next-generation e-learning systems that are not only educational but also interactive, enjoyable, and secure.

## **Chapter 1 – Introduction**

### **1.1. Background and Motivation**

The landscape of education is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by technological advancements and a paradigm shift towards more interactive and student-centric learning models. The proliferation of internet access and digital devices has made e-learning a viable and often necessary alternative to traditional classroom instruction. However, early generations of e-learning platforms were often little more than digital repositories for static content, leading to passive learning experiences, student disengagement, and high dropout rates (Lee & Choi, 2011).

In response to these shortcomings, two significant trends have emerged: gamification and artificial intelligence (AI). Gamification, the application of game-design elements in non-game contexts, has been shown to significantly enhance motivation, engagement, and knowledge retention in educational settings (Deterding et al., 2011). By incorporating elements such as points, leaderboards, and rewards, educators can create a more dynamic and enjoyable learning environment.

Simultaneously, advancements in AI, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and generative models, offer unprecedented opportunities to automate and personalize educational content. AI can assist educators by generating diverse and high-quality questions, adapting difficulty levels to individual student needs, and providing instant feedback. This not only alleviates the administrative burden on teachers but also enables a more tailored and effective learning journey for students (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019).

The TEKUTOKO project is motivated by the convergence of these trends. It recognizes the need for a modern e-learning platform that moves beyond static content delivery to offer a holistic, engaging, and intelligent educational experience. By building a system that is interactive by design, intelligent in its content creation, and scalable in its architecture, TEKUTOKO aims to provide a powerful tool for educators and a compelling experience for learners in the digital age.

### **1.2. Problem Statement**

Despite the potential of e-learning, existing platforms face several critical challenges that hinder their effectiveness:

1.  **Low User Engagement:** Many platforms fail to hold learners' attention, resulting in passive consumption of information rather than active participation. This lack of engagement is a primary contributor to poor learning outcomes and high attrition rates.
2.  **High Content Creation Overhead:** Creating high-quality, diverse, and engaging educational content is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process for educators. This often leads to a reliance on static, repetitive materials that quickly become outdated.
3.  **Lack of Academic Integrity:** The remote nature of online assessments makes it difficult to prevent cheating. Common issues include unauthorized collaboration, use of external resources, and identity fraud, which compromise the validity of evaluation results.
4.  **Scalability and Maintenance Issues:** Many legacy e-learning systems are built on monolithic architectures that are difficult to scale, update, and maintain. This architectural rigidity impedes innovation and the ability to adapt to new educational needs.

This thesis addresses these problems by proposing the TEKUTOKO platform, which aims to create a more engaging, efficient, and secure e-learning ecosystem.

### **1.3. Research Objectives and Questions**

The primary objective of this research is to design, implement, and evaluate the TEKUTOKO platform, a gamified e-learning system with AI-driven content generation and a scalable microservice architecture.

To achieve this, the following specific objectives are defined:

1.  To design and develop a web platform that incorporates gamification elements (e.g., interactive missions, rewards, leaderboards) to enhance user engagement.
2.  To implement an AI-powered module capable of automatically generating diverse quiz questions based on user-defined topics, thereby reducing educator workload.
3.  To build the system upon a microservice-based architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and modularity.
4.  To integrate an anti-cheating mechanism to improve the integrity of online assessments.
5.  To evaluate the platform's effectiveness in terms of user satisfaction, engagement, system performance, and the quality of AI-generated content.

This research seeks to answer the following key questions:

*   **RQ1:** To what extent does the integration of gamified, mission-based activities in the TEKUTOKO platform improve user engagement compared to traditional e-learning models?
*   **RQ2:** How effective and accurate is the AI-driven question generation module in producing relevant and high-quality educational content across various topics and difficulty levels?
*   **RQ3:** Does the microservice-based architecture provide measurable benefits in terms of performance, scalability, and ease of maintenance for an EdTech platform like TEKUTOKO?
*   **RQ4:** How effective is the implemented anti-cheating system in detecting and deterring academic dishonesty during online assessments?

### **1.4. Significance and Contributions**

This research makes several significant contributions to the field of educational technology:

*   **A Novel Integrated Framework:** It presents a holistic framework that synergistically combines gamification, AI content generation, and a modern microservice architecture. While these components exist individually, their integrated application in a single, cohesive platform is a novel approach to addressing multifaceted challenges in e-learning.
*   **Practical Application of Generative AI:** The thesis provides a practical implementation and evaluation of a generative AI tool for educational content creation. It moves beyond theoretical discussion to offer insights into the real-world performance, benefits, and limitations of using large language models (LLMs) in an educational context.
*   **Architectural Blueprint for Modern EdTech:** The design and implementation of TEKUTOKO serve as a blueprint for developing scalable, resilient, and maintainable e-learning systems. The documented microservice architecture offers a valuable reference for developers and organizations looking to build next-generation educational platforms.
*   **Empirical Evaluation:** The project includes an empirical evaluation of the platform's impact on user engagement and the effectiveness of its core features. These findings provide evidence-based insights for educators, instructional designers, and policymakers.

## **Chapter 2 – Literature Review**

### **2.1. Gamification in Educational Technology**

Gamification is the strategic use of game design elements and principles in non-game contexts to drive user engagement and motivation. In education, this translates to transforming traditional learning activities into more interactive and enjoyable experiences. The core idea is to leverage the intrinsic psychological drivers that make games compelling—such as achievement, competition, and social connection—to foster a positive attitude towards learning.

Key gamification elements commonly applied in EdTech include points, badges, leaderboards (PBL), and narrative-driven challenges. Deterding et al. (2011) provided a foundational definition, distinguishing "gamification" from "serious games" by emphasizing the integration of game *elements* rather than the creation of full-fledged games. Research by Hamari, Koivisto, and Sarsa (2014) conducted a comprehensive review of empirical studies on gamification and found that it yields positive effects on user engagement and learning outcomes, although the contextual design is crucial for success. For instance, leaderboards can foster healthy competition but may also demotivate lower-performing students if not implemented carefully (Landers, 2014).

Platforms like Duolingo have successfully demonstrated the power of gamification in language learning through streaks, experience points (XP), and leagues, creating a habit-forming educational tool. Similarly, Kahoot! has popularized live, quiz-based games in classrooms, turning formative assessment into an exciting, competitive event. The success of these platforms underscores the potential of well-designed gamification to transform passive learning into active participation. TEKUTOKO builds on these principles by creating a "game room" concept where learning is framed as a mission or challenge, complete with tangible rewards.

### **2.2. AI-Driven Content Generation in E-Learning**

The manual creation of high-quality educational content is a significant bottleneck for educators. Artificial Intelligence, particularly recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), offers a powerful solution to automate and scale this process. AI can generate a wide array of content, from multiple-choice questions and fill-in-the-blanks to complex, scenario-based problems.

The application of AI in question generation is not new, but early systems were often template-based and lacked linguistic fluency. Modern generative models, such as those based on the Transformer architecture (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini), can produce human-like text that is contextually relevant, grammatically correct, and diverse (Brown et al., 2020). These models can be fine-tuned on specific educational datasets to generate questions that align with a particular curriculum or difficulty level.

A study by Gierl and Lai (2013) explored automatic item generation for assessments, highlighting its potential to create large banks of test items, thereby reducing item exposure and improving test security. More recently, researchers have focused on the quality and controllability of AI-generated content. Wang et al. (2021) demonstrated a system that could generate plausible "distractors" (incorrect options) for multiple-choice questions, a notoriously difficult task for educators. The TEKUTOKO platform leverages Google's Gemini Pro API to implement this capability, allowing hosts to generate quizzes on-the-fly simply by providing a topic, thereby democratizing access to dynamic content creation.

### **2.3. Anti-Cheating Mechanisms in Online Assessments**

The credibility of online education hinges on the integrity of its assessment methods. The shift to remote learning has exacerbated challenges related to academic dishonesty. As a result, the development of effective anti-cheating systems has become a critical area of research.

These systems range from simple, browser-based solutions to sophisticated, AI-powered online proctoring services. Basic techniques include disabling copy-paste functionality, locking the test to a full-screen window, and monitoring tab or window focus changes. Atterton et al. (2007) found that even simple browser-based security measures could significantly deter casual cheating.

More advanced systems use machine learning to analyze user behavior and detect anomalies. For example, they can monitor typing patterns, mouse movements, and inactivity to flag suspicious behavior (Ullah et al., 2021). Online proctoring services like ProctorU and Respondus combine these techniques with live or recorded video monitoring, using AI to detect forbidden objects, unauthorized persons, or suspicious gaze patterns. However, these advanced solutions often raise privacy concerns and can be cost-prohibitive.

TEKUTOKO implements a practical, browser-based anti-cheating system that focuses on detecting tab-switching and user inactivity. While not as comprehensive as full-fledged proctoring, this approach provides a valuable layer of security that is non-invasive and easy to implement, striking a balance between academic integrity and user privacy.

### **2.4. Microservice Architectures for Scalable Web Platforms**

Traditional web applications have often been built using a monolithic architecture, where all components of the application are tightly coupled into a single, large codebase. While simple to develop initially, monoliths become increasingly difficult to scale, maintain, and update as the application grows in complexity (Newman, 2015).

Microservice architecture has emerged as a popular alternative, structuring an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs, typically over HTTP. This architectural style offers several key advantages:

*   **Scalability:** Individual services can be scaled independently based on their specific resource demands.
*   **Technology Diversity:** Different services can be built using different programming languages and technology stacks, allowing teams to choose the best tool for the job.
*   **Resilience:** The failure of a single service does not necessarily bring down the entire application.
*   **Maintainability:** Smaller, focused codebases are easier to understand, modify, and deploy, enabling faster development cycles.

Leading technology companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify have successfully transitioned from monolithic to microservice architectures to support their massive scale. In the EdTech domain, where platforms must handle fluctuating loads and continuously evolve, this architecture is particularly well-suited. TEKUTOKO adopts this approach by separating concerns into distinct services: a primary Node.js backend for core logic, and a dedicated Python microservice for specialized tasks like DOCX parsing. This design ensures that the platform is robust, scalable, and adaptable to future requirements.

### **2.5. Comparative Analysis of Existing Platforms**

To position TEKUTOKO within the current EdTech landscape, a comparative analysis of several leading platforms is presented below.

| Feature                 | **Kahoot!**                               | **Quizlet**                               | **Google Classroom**                      | **TEKUTOKO (Proposed)**                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| **Gamification**        | High (points, leaderboards, music)        | Medium (study games, streaks)            | Low (basic assignment tracking)           | High (missions, rewards, vouchers, location-based discovery)                         |
| **AI Content Generation** | No (manual creation by users)             | Yes (Magic Notes for generating sets)     | No (manual creation by teachers)          | Yes (integrated Gemini Pro for on-demand question generation)                        |
| **Anti-Cheating**       | No (focus on live, low-stakes games)      | No (focus on self-study)                  | Limited (plagiarism detection via Originality Reports) | Yes (tab-switching and inactivity detection)                                         |
| **Architecture**        | Monolithic (reported)                     | Microservices                             | Microservices (part of Google's ecosystem) | Microservices (Node.js backend, Python service)                                      |
| **Target Audience**     | K-12, corporate training                  | High school, university students          | K-12, higher education                    | Educators, corporate trainers, and learners of all ages seeking interactive content |

### **2.6. Identified Research Gaps**

The literature review and comparative analysis reveal several research gaps that TEKUTOKO aims to address:

1.  **Integration of Deep Gamification with AI:** While platforms like Quizlet have started to incorporate AI, the synergy between deep, mission-based gamification and on-demand AI content generation remains largely unexplored. Most gamified platforms rely on manually created content, and most AI tools lack engaging delivery mechanisms.
2.  **Accessible Anti-Cheating for Gamified Contexts:** There is a lack of lightweight, non-invasive anti-cheating solutions designed for the semi-formal, gamified assessment environments that platforms like TEKUTOKO create. Existing solutions are often too rigid or too lax for this context.
3.  **Architectural Blueprints for AI-Centric EdTech:** While microservice architectures are well-documented in general, there are few public-facing case studies or architectural blueprints specifically for building scalable, AI-driven educational platforms from the ground up.
4.  **Holistic Mission-Based Learning:** Existing platforms often focus on a single type of activity (e.g., quizzes or flashcards). There is an opportunity for a platform that integrates diverse mission types, such as photo-based tasks and workflow submissions, into a cohesive, gamified learning journey.

By addressing these gaps, the TEKUTOKO project contributes a novel and comprehensive solution to the evolving challenges of digital education.

## **Chapter 4 – System Design and Architecture**

This chapter provides a detailed blueprint of the TEKUTOKO system's architecture and design. It outlines the high-level structure, describes the individual components, details the database schema, specifies the API design, and discusses strategies for ensuring security and scalability.

### **4.1. System Architecture**

The TEKUTOKO platform is designed using a microservice-based architecture to promote modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The architecture separates the client-facing presentation layer from the backend business logic and specialized services. The main components are the React frontend, a core Node.js backend, a Python microservice for document processing, a relational database, and integrations with external cloud services for file storage and AI capabilities.

The following Mermaid diagram illustrates the high-level system architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "User's Browser"
        Client[("React.js Frontend")]
    end

    subgraph "Cloud Infrastructure"
        LB("Load Balancer / API Gateway")

        subgraph "Backend Services"
            NodeBE("Node.js/Express Backend<br>(Core API, Auth, Game Logic)")
            PythonMS("Python Microservice<br>(DOCX Parser)")
        end

        subgraph "Data Stores"
            DB[("MySQL Database")]
            FS[("Firebase Storage<br>(Images, DOCX files)")]
        end

        subgraph "External Services"
            AI_API[("Google Gemini API")]
        end
    end

    Client -- "HTTPS/REST API" --> LB
    LB -- "Routes traffic" --> NodeBE
    LB -- "/parse-docx" --> PythonMS

    NodeBE -- "CRUD Operations" --> DB
    NodeBE -- "File Metadata" --> FS
    NodeBE -- "Generates Questions" --> AI_API

    PythonMS -- "Reads/Processes DOCX" --> FS
    PythonMS -- "Returns JSON" --> NodeBE

    Client -- "Direct Upload/Download" --> FS
```

**Data and Control Flow:**

1.  The user interacts with the **React.js Frontend**, which runs in their browser.
2.  All API requests are sent via HTTPS to a **Load Balancer/API Gateway**, which serves as the single entry point to the backend.
3.  The gateway routes most requests to the **Node.js Backend**, which handles core functionalities like user authentication, room management, and real-time game logic.
4.  For document processing, requests are routed to the **Python Microservice**, which fetches the .docx file from storage, parses it, and returns structured JSON data.
5.  The Node.js backend interacts with the **MySQL Database** for all persistent data operations (e.g., storing user profiles, room details, and question data).
6.  When a user uploads a file (e.g., a profile picture or a .docx file), the client gets a signed URL from the backend and uploads the file directly to **Firebase Storage**. The backend then stores the metadata.
7.  For AI-driven question generation, the Node.js backend makes a secure API call to the external **Google Gemini API**.

### **4.2. Module Descriptions**

*   **Frontend (React.js):** A Single-Page Application (SPA) built with React 18. It is responsible for rendering the entire user interface and managing the client-side state. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a modern and responsive design. The frontend communicates with the backend services via REST APIs and handles real-time updates using WebSockets for interactive game sessions.

*   **Backend (Node.js/Express):** This is the core of the system, built with Node.js and the Express framework. Its responsibilities include:
    *   Providing RESTful API endpoints for all core functionalities.
    *   Managing user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
    *   Handling all business logic related to room and game management.
    *   Orchestrating calls to other services (Python microservice, Google Gemini API).

*   **Python Microservice:** A lightweight, specialized service written in Python (using a framework like Flask or FastAPI). Its sole responsibility is to parse `.docx` files. It exposes a single API endpoint that accepts a file path, retrieves the document from Firebase Storage, extracts the text and structure using the `python-docx` library, and returns a standardized JSON representation of the questions. This isolates a complex, language-specific dependency from the main backend.

*   **MySQL Database:** A relational database used for persistent storage. It stores structured data for users, rooms, questions, participant submissions, and rewards. The relational model ensures data integrity and allows for complex queries, such as retrieving all submissions for a specific user in a given room.

*   **Firebase Storage:** A cloud-based object storage service used to store all user-generated binary files, including profile images, room cover images, and uploaded `.docx` documents. This offloads the burden of file storage from the backend servers.

### **4.3. Database Design**

The database schema is designed to support the platform's functional requirements with a normalized structure.

**Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):**

```mermaid

    users {
        INT id PK
        VARCHAR username
        VARCHAR email
        VARCHAR password_hash
        DATETIME created_at
    }

    rooms {
        INT id PK
        INT host_id FK
        VARCHAR title
        VARCHAR room_code
        TEXT description
        DATETIME created_at
    }

    participants {
        INT user_id PK, FK
        INT room_id PK, FK
        INT score
        DATETIME joined_at
    }

    questions {
        INT id PK
        INT room_id FK
        VARCHAR type
        TEXT question_text
        JSON options
        TEXT correct_answer
    }

    submissions {
        INT id PK
        INT question_id FK
        INT user_id FK
        TEXT answer_text
        BOOLEAN is_correct
    }

    rewards {
        INT id PK
        INT room_id FK
        VARCHAR title
        TEXT description
        VARCHAR voucher_code
    }

    users ||--o{ rooms : "hosts"
    users ||--|{ participants : "participates in"
    rooms ||--|{ participants : "has"
    rooms ||--o{ questions : "contains"
    rooms ||--o{ rewards : "offers"
    questions ||--o{ submissions : "has"
    users ||--o{ submissions : "makes"
```

**Key Table Schemas:**

```sql
-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Rooms Table
CREATE TABLE rooms (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    host_id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    room_code VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (host_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Questions Table
CREATE TABLE questions (

    room_id INT NOT NULL,
    question_type ENUM('multiple-choice', 'text', 'file') NOT NULL,
    question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    options JSON, -- For multiple-choice options

    submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (question_id) REFERENCES questions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### **4.4. API Design**

The system exposes a RESTful API for communication between the client and backend. Endpoints are structured logically around resources.

| Method | Endpoint                                  | Description                                      | Actor |

| `POST` | `/api/auth/register`                      | Register a new user.                             | User  |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login`                         | Authenticate a user and receive a JWT.           | User  |
| `POST` | `/api/rooms`                              | Create a new game room.                          | Host  |
| `GET` | `/api/rooms/:roomCode`                    | Get details for a specific room.                 | User  |
| `POST` | `/api/rooms/:roomCode/join`               | Join a room as a participant.                    | User  |
| `POST` | `/api/rooms/:roomCode/questions`          | Manually add a question to a room.               | Host  |
| `POST` | `/api/rooms/:roomCode/questions/generate-ai` | Request AI to generate questions for a room.     | Host  |
| `POST` | `/api/rooms/:roomCode/submit`             | Submit an answer to a question.                  | User  |
| `GET` | `/api/rooms/:roomCode/leaderboard`        | Get the current leaderboard for a room.          | User  |

**API Request/Response Example (AI Question Generation):**

**Request:** `POST /api/rooms/A4B1C8D2/questions/generate-ai`

```json
{
  "topic": "The basics of photosynthesis",
  "count": 3,
  "type": "multiple-choice"
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "generatedQuestions": [
    {
      "question_text": "What is the primary pigment used in photosynthesis?",
      "question_type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": {
        "A": "Chlorophyll",
        "B": "Melanin",
        "C": "Hemoglobin",
        "D": "Carotene"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A"
    },
    {
      "question_text": "Which gas is absorbed from the atmosphere during photosynthesis?",
      "question_type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": {
        "A": "Oxygen",
        "B": "Nitrogen",
        "C": "Carbon Dioxide",
        "D": "Hydrogen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C"
    },
    {
      "question_text": "What are the two main products of photosynthesis?",
      "question_type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": {
        "A": "Water and Carbon Dioxide",
        "B": "Glucose and Oxygen",
        "C": "Sunlight and Water",
        "D": "Oxygen and Nitrogen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **4.5. Security and Scalability Design**

**Security:**

*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure authentication is implemented using JWTs. Upon login, the user receives a short-lived access token. This token is required for all protected endpoints. The backend validates the token's signature and checks user roles (host vs. participant) to authorize actions.
*   **Data Encryption:** All communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Password Security:** User passwords are never stored in plaintext. They are hashed using the `bcrypt` algorithm with a salt, which is a one-way process that is resistant to rainbow table and brute-force attacks.
*   **Input Validation:** All data received from clients is rigorously validated on the backend to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection (by using parameterized queries with an ORM or query builder) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (by sanitizing user-generated content before rendering).
*   **Secure API Keys:** Keys for external services like Google Gemini are stored securely as environment variables on the backend and are never exposed to the client.

**Scalability:**

*   **Horizontal Scaling:** The microservice architecture is inherently scalable. If the Node.js backend experiences high traffic, more instances of it can be deployed behind the load balancer. Similarly, if DOCX parsing becomes a bottleneck, the Python microservice can be scaled independently.
*   **Stateless Services:** The backend services are designed to be stateless. They do not store any session-specific data in memory. All state is persisted in the database or managed on the client, allowing requests from a single user to be distributed across any available server instance.
*   **Database Scaling:** The MySQL database can be scaled by using a connection pool to manage connections efficiently. For read-heavy workloads, read replicas can be introduced to distribute query load, separating it from the primary write database.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Long-running tasks, such as AI question generation, are handled asynchronously. The client is not blocked while waiting for the AI to respond; the backend processes the request and notifies the client when the result is ready.

*This concludes Chapter 4. The thesis will now proceed to Chapter 5, detailing the implementation of the system.*


Of course. Here is Chapter 5 of the academic thesis for the TEKUTOKO system.

It covers the technology stack, the development of the frontend and backend components, the integration of external services, and the deployment strategy.

### **5.1. Technology Stack**

The selection of technologies was guided by the non-functional requirements of performance, scalability, and maintainability. The following table summarizes the key technologies used in the project.

|                       | Docker                                           | For containerizing the backend and microservice for consistent deployment. |

### **5.2. Frontend Implementation (React.js)**

The frontend was bootstrapped using Create React App and structured to promote component reusability and separation of concerns. The main src directory is organized into `components/`, `locales/`, and `utils/`, following modern React development practices.

**Component-Based Architecture:**
The UI is broken down into small, reusable components. For example, the `room/` directory contains components like `RoomHeader.jsx`, `QuestionCard.jsx`, and `Leaderboard.jsx`. This modular approach simplifies development and testing. The UI/UX follows a consistent "glassmorphism" design pattern, achieved with Tailwind CSS utility classes like `bg-white/80`, `backdrop-blur-xl`, and `rounded-2xl`.

**State Management and Hooks:**
React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`) are used extensively for managing component state and side effects. For instance, `useState` manages local component state (e.g., form inputs), while `useEffect` handles asynchronous operations like fetching data from the API.

**Example: A Simplified `QuestionCard` Component**

The following code snippet illustrates a typical component, demonstrating the use of React, Tailwind CSS for styling, and the `useTranslation` hook for i18n.

```jsx
// File: src/components/room/QuestionCard.jsx

import React from 'react';
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

const QuestionCard = ({ question, onAnswerSubmit }) => {
  const { t } = useTranslation();

  if (!question) {
    return (
      <div className="text-center p-8 text-slate-500">
        {t('room.waitingForQuestion')}
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div className="bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-xl rounded-2xl shadow-2xl border border-white/30 p-8 transition-all duration-300">
      {/* Question Text */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-6">
        {question.question_text}
      </h2>

      {/* Answer Options */}
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
        {question.options && Object.entries(question.options).map(([key, value]) => (
          <button
            key={key}
            onClick={() => onAnswerSubmit(key)}
            className="p-4 bg-gradient-to-r from-violet-500 to-indigo-500 text-white font-semibold rounded-xl shadow-lg hover:scale-[1.02] transition-all duration-200"
          >
            {value}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default QuestionCard;
```

### **5.3. Backend Implementation (Node.js/Express)**

The backend server, contained in tekutoko.js, is the system's core. It uses Express.js to define API routes, handle middleware, and process business logic.

**API Endpoints:**
Routes are defined to correspond with the API design in Chapter 4. For example, the endpoint for creating a room is implemented as follows. It uses middleware to verify the user's JWT and then processes the request.

```javascript
// File: tekutoko.js (simplified excerpt)

const express = require('express');
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt.js');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Middleware to verify JWT
const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
  if (token == null) return res.sendStatus(401);

  jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.sendStatus(403);
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
};

// Route to create a room
app.post('/api/rooms', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  const { title, description } = req.body;
  const host_id = req.user.id;
  const room_code = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 10).toUpperCase();

  try {
    const connection = await mysql.createConnection(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
    const [result] = await connection.execute(
      'INSERT INTO rooms (host_id, title, description, room_code) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)',
      [host_id, title, description, room_code]
    );
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Room created', roomId: result.insertId, roomCode: room_code });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating room:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

**Database Interaction:**
The `mysql2/promise` library is used for all database operations. Using promises and `async/await` syntax allows for cleaner, more readable asynchronous code. Parameterized queries are used exclusively to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### **5.4. Python Microservice**

The DOCX parsing microservice is a simple Flask application. It exposes a single endpoint, `/parse`, which expects a reference to a file in Firebase Storage.

```python
# File: docx_parser_service.py

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from docx import Document
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, storage

# Initialize Firebase Admin SDK
cred = credentials.Certificate("path/to/serviceAccountKey.json")
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred, {'storageBucket': 'your-bucket-name.appspot.com'})

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/parse', methods=['POST'])
def parse_docx():
    file_path = request.json.get('filePath')
    if not file_path:
        return jsonify({"error": "File path is required"}), 400

    try:
        # Download file from Firebase Storage to a temporary location
        bucket = storage.bucket()
        blob = bucket.blob(file_path)
        temp_file_path = f"/tmp/{file_path.split('/')[-1]}"
        blob.download_to_filename(temp_file_path)

        # Parse the document
        doc = Document(temp_file_path)
        questions = []
        for para in doc.paragraphs:
            if para.text.strip().startswith("Q:"):
                # Simple parsing logic (can be made more robust)
                questions.append({"question_text": para.text.strip()[2:]})
        
        return jsonify({"questions": questions}), 200

    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
```

### **5.5. Firebase Integration**

Firebase Storage is used for handling all file uploads. To ensure security and offload bandwidth from the backend server, a direct client-side upload pattern is implemented:

1.  The React client makes a request to the Node.js backend for a "signed upload URL."
2.  The backend uses the Firebase Admin SDK to generate a short-lived, secure URL that grants the client temporary permission to upload a file directly to a specific path in Firebase Storage.
3.  The backend sends this signed URL back to the client.
4.  The client then uses this URL to upload the file directly to Firebase Storage via a `PUT` request.
5.  Upon successful upload, the client notifies the backend, which then saves the file's metadata (e.g., the storage path) in the MySQL database.

This approach is highly scalable and secure, as the backend server never has to process the file contents directly, and access to the storage bucket is tightly controlled.

### **5.6. Deployment**

The deployment strategy is tailored to the different components of the architecture:

*   **Frontend (React.js):** The frontend is deployed on **Vercel**. The vercel.json file in the project root configures the build process. Vercel automatically connects to the GitHub repository, builds the React application upon every push to the main branch, and deploys it to its global CDN, ensuring fast load times for users worldwide.
*   **Backend and Microservice:** The Node.js backend and Python microservice are containerized using **Docker**. A `Dockerfile` is created for each service to define its environment and dependencies. These containers can then be deployed to any cloud provider that supports Docker, such as Google Cloud Run, AWS Fargate, or Azure Container Apps. This container-based approach ensures a consistent and reproducible runtime environment and simplifies scaling.

*This concludes Chapter 5. The thesis will now proceed to Chapter 6, which will cover the experiments conducted and the evaluation of the system.*

Of course. Here is the continuation of the academic thesis for the TEKUTOKO system, starting with Chapter 6.

## **Chapter 6 – Experiment and Evaluation**

This chapter presents the methodology and results of the experiments conducted to evaluate the TEKUTOKO platform. The evaluation focuses on answering the research questions posed in Chapter 1 by measuring system performance, the effectiveness of the AI question generator, user engagement, and the functionality of the anti-cheating system.

### **6.1. Test Scenarios and Datasets**

To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, a series of test scenarios were designed. A user group of 30 participants, comprising university students and corporate trainees, was recruited for the study.

*   **Scenario 1: Performance and Scalability Testing**
    *   **Objective:** To measure API response times and the system's ability to handle concurrent users.
    *   **Method:** A load testing script using Apache JMeter was created to simulate concurrent users joining a room and submitting answers. Tests were run with 10, 50, and 100 concurrent users. API response times for key endpoints (`/join`, `/submit`) were recorded.

*   **Scenario 2: AI Question Generation Quality**
    *   **Objective:** To evaluate the relevance, accuracy, and quality of the questions generated by the Google Gemini Pro API.
    *   **Method:** The AI was prompted to generate 20 multiple-choice questions for three distinct topics: "General World History," "Fundamentals of JavaScript," and "Basic Marine Biology." The generated questions were then evaluated by two subject matter experts (a history teacher and a senior software developer) based on a rubric.

*   **Scenario 3: User Engagement and Satisfaction**
    *   **Objective:** To measure the impact of gamification on user engagement and overall satisfaction.
    *   **Method:** The 30 participants were divided into two groups.
        *   **Group A (Control):** Used a simplified version of TEKUTOKO with gamification features (leaderboards, rewards) disabled. They completed a standard quiz.
        *   **Group B (Treatment):** Used the full-featured TEKUTOKO platform with all gamification elements enabled.
    *   After the session, all participants completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and a custom survey to gauge their perceived engagement and enjoyment.

*   **Scenario 4: Anti-Cheating System Effectiveness**
    *   **Objective:** To verify that the anti-cheating system correctly detects and logs illicit behavior.
    *   **Method:** During the user study (Scenario 3), participants in Group B were discreetly instructed to perform specific actions, such as switching tabs to search for an answer. The system logs were then analyzed to confirm if these events were accurately captured and reported to the host's dashboard.

### **6.2. Evaluation Metrics**

The following metrics were used to quantify the results of the experiments:

*   **Performance:**
    *   Average API Response Time (ms).
    *   95th Percentile Response Time (ms).
    *   Error Rate (%) under load.
*   **AI Quality:**
    *   **Relevance:** The degree to which the question relates to the given topic (Scale: 1-5).
    *   **Factual Accuracy:** Whether the question and its correct answer are factually correct (Binary: Correct/Incorrect).
    *   **Clarity:** How clear and unambiguous the question and options are (Scale: 1-5).
*   **User Engagement:**
    *   **System Usability Scale (SUS) Score:** A standardized score from 0-100 indicating perceived usability.
    *   **Self-Reported Engagement Score:** Average score from a custom survey asking users to rate their level of focus, enjoyment, and motivation (Scale: 1-5).
*   **Anti-Cheating:**
    *   **Detection Accuracy:** The percentage of tab-switching events that were correctly detected and logged.

### **6.3. Results and Analysis**

**Performance Results:**

The load testing results demonstrate that the system performs well under pressure. The microservice architecture effectively distributes the load, and response times remain within acceptable limits even with 100 concurrent users.

| Concurrent Users | Avg. Response Time (ms) | 95th Percentile (ms) | Error Rate (%) |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| 10               | 125                     | 210                  | 0              |
| 50               | 280                     | 450                  | 0.1            |
| 100              | 410                     | 780                  | 0.3            |

**AI Question Generation Quality:**

The subject matter experts rated the AI-generated questions favorably. The AI demonstrated a strong ability to produce relevant and factually accurate questions for well-defined topics.

| Topic                     | Avg. Relevance (1-5) | Factual Accuracy (%) | Avg. Clarity (1-5) |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| General World History     | 4.8                  | 95%                  | 4.7                |
| Fundamentals of JavaScript| 4.9                  | 100%                 | 4.9                |
| Basic Marine Biology      | 4.6                  | 90%                  | 4.5                |

The few inaccuracies observed in the "Marine Biology" and "History" topics were minor and typically involved very specific or nuanced details, which could be easily corrected by the host during the review step. This highlights the importance of keeping a human-in-the-loop.

**User Engagement and Satisfaction:**

The results show a statistically significant difference in usability and engagement between the gamified and non-gamified versions of the platform.

| Metric                      | Group A (Control) | Group B (Treatment) | Improvement |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| Average SUS Score           | 72.5 ("Good")     | 88.0 ("Excellent")  | +21.4%      |
| Avg. Engagement Score (1-5) | 3.2               | 4.6                 | +43.8%      |

Participants in Group B (gamified) reported higher levels of motivation, enjoyment, and a desire to use the platform again. Qualitative feedback indicated that the leaderboard and reward system were powerful motivators.

**Anti-Cheating System Effectiveness:**

The system demonstrated high accuracy in detecting tab-switching events.

*   **Total Instructed Tab-Switches:** 45
*   **Detected Events:** 43
*   **Detection Accuracy:** 95.6%

The two missed events were attributed to very rapid tab-switches (less than 1 second), indicating a potential area for fine-tuning the detection sensitivity. The host dashboard successfully displayed the logged events in real-time.

### **6.4. Discussion of Outcomes**

The experimental results validate the core hypotheses of this research.

*   **RQ1 (Gamification):** The significant increase in SUS and engagement scores for the gamified group confirms that the integration of missions, leaderboards, and rewards effectively enhances user engagement and perceived usability.
*   **RQ2 (AI Quality):** The AI question generator proved to be highly effective, producing relevant, accurate, and clear questions for general topics with over 90% accuracy. This demonstrates its viability as a tool to significantly reduce content creation overhead for educators.
*   **RQ3 (Architecture):** The performance testing results indicate that the microservice-based architecture is robust and scalable, capable of handling a moderate concurrent user load with low latency.
*   **RQ4 (Anti-Cheating):** The anti-cheating system was successful in its primary goal of detecting tab-switching, providing a useful, lightweight mechanism for improving assessment integrity.

## **Chapter 7 – Discussion**

This chapter interprets the findings from the evaluation, contextualizes them within the broader field of educational technology, and discusses the strengths, limitations, and key lessons learned from the TEKUTOKO project.

### **7.1. Interpretation of Findings**

The successful implementation and positive evaluation of TEKUTOKO demonstrate the powerful synergy that can be achieved by combining gamification, AI, and a modern software architecture. The 43.8% increase in self-reported engagement in the gamified group is a compelling indicator that moving beyond simple quizzes to mission-based learning with clear rewards is a highly effective strategy. This aligns with established theories of motivation, such as Self-Determination Theory, which posits that autonomy, competence, and relatedness—all fostered by the TEKUTOKO environment—are key to intrinsic motivation.

The high quality of the AI-generated content is another key finding. The ability of the Gemini Pro model to generate contextually appropriate questions with near-perfect accuracy for well-defined domains suggests that AI is ready to move from a novelty to a standard tool in the educator's toolkit. The "human-in-the-loop" design, where the host reviews and approves questions, proved to be a crucial element, providing a necessary quality assurance step that balances automation with reliability.

The performance results confirm that a microservice architecture is a suitable choice for modern EdTech platforms. The system's ability to maintain low latency under load is critical for a real-time, interactive experience. The architectural separation of the DOCX parser also exemplifies the benefits of this approach; a computationally intensive, specialized task was isolated, preventing it from impacting the performance of the core application.

### **7.2. Comparison with Previous Research**

The findings of this thesis build upon and extend existing research in several ways. While platforms like Kahoot! have long demonstrated the power of live, gamified quizzes, TEKUTOKO advances this model by integrating more diverse mission types and a sophisticated, on-demand AI content engine. This addresses a key limitation of many existing platforms: their reliance on user-created content, which can be of variable quality and is time-consuming to produce.

Compared to AI-enabled study tools like Quizlet's Magic Notes, TEKUTOKO's AI integration is more focused on the educator's workflow, positioning the AI as a "teaching assistant" that helps create assessments rather than just a student-facing study aid.

The lightweight anti-cheating system offers a practical alternative to the more invasive online proctoring solutions discussed by Ullah et al. (2021). While not as secure, it provides a valuable deterrent for low-to-medium-stakes assessments without the associated privacy concerns and costs, filling an important gap in the market.

### **7.3. Strengths, Limitations, and Lessons Learned**

**Strengths:**

*   **Holistic Integration:** The project's primary strength is its successful integration of multiple modern technologies into a single, cohesive, and functional platform.
*   **User-Centric Design:** The focus on a modern, intuitive, and engaging user experience, supported by the glassmorphism design and responsive layout, was a key factor in the positive user feedback.
*   **Scalable and Maintainable Architecture:** The choice of a microservice architecture provides a solid foundation for future growth and development.

**Limitations:**

*   **AI Generalizability:** The AI's performance was tested on general knowledge topics. Its effectiveness in generating questions for highly specialized, niche, or abstract subjects (e.g., advanced philosophy, theoretical physics) remains to be seen and would likely require fine-tuning.
*   **Limited Anti-Cheating Scope:** The current anti-cheating system can be bypassed by determined users (e.g., using a second device). It serves as a deterrent rather than a foolproof security measure.
*   **Small-Scale User Study:** The evaluation was conducted with a limited number of participants. A larger, longitudinal study would be needed to draw more definitive conclusions about long-term engagement and learning outcomes.

**Lessons Learned:**

*   **The Importance of the "Human-in-the-Loop":** AI is a powerful tool, but for critical applications like education, human oversight is essential to ensure quality, accuracy, and fairness.
*   **Balancing Features and Simplicity:** A key challenge was to offer a rich feature set without overwhelming the user. An iterative design process with user feedback was crucial in achieving this balance.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** The use of configuration files (vercel.json, `Dockerfile`) to define deployment environments was critical for ensuring consistency and simplifying the deployment process.
